Some TensorFlow examples from working through chapters 13 and 14 of the book Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka. 

I started off by getting familiar with some lower-level TensorFlow API by working with some array structures then implementing
the ordinary least squares problem. After I felt comfortable with TensorFlow I implemented two MLPs that do the same thing, they
classifiy handwritten digits 0-9 from the popular MNIST handwritten character dataset. Also learned how to save and restore a
regression model to train more or make predictions later on.

This was for an assignment for Introduction to Machine Learning ---  CS 49AE.
